        <p>
            I'm Levi and I am a huge BYU fan! I've watched BYU play since I was little, and I've only become a bigger fan.
            Now that I'm a student here I make sure to attend every game, and watch the away ones too!
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to being a fan, I now have the opportunity to work for the team!
            I'm currently a Data Science Intern for the Men's Team's Strength and Conditioning Coach.
            Getting to work at the facilities, interact with the players, and help the team is a dream come true.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to learn the basics of the game, I can help you understand the rules,
            positions, and common plays. I can also help you learn about the rich history of BYU's basketball team!
